# Cross-Chain Interop Research

[Supported by Optimism Governance](https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-2498144202521042)

The goal of this effort is to conduct a thorough investigation of cross-chain — and in particular
cross-rollup — interoperability concerns.

Bluntly, one could equate interoperability with bridging: message-passing bridges, asset bridges,
and atomic cross-chain transaction bundles.
