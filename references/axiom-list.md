A list of statements we consider to be true and will guide our work.

See also [Hypothesis List](./hypothesis-list.md).

1. Trust-minimized bridges don't really exist in the presence of hard forks, though mitigations are
   possible.

1. If safety is to be guaranteed, bridging speed is bound by the finality delay of
   the source chain, unless the destination chain re-orgs whenever the source chain re-orgs (e.g.
   rollups).

1. Fully-general atomic message-passing is not achievable with third-party bridges.
