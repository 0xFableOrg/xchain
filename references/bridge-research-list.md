# Bridge Research List

A list of investigation into innovative bridging solutions, focusing on things that haven't been
implemented or proven, or only at the fringe. We should in particular focus on *native* bridging,
i.e. bridging systems that are integrated into the blockchain's implementation since that is likely
to be the larger unexplored design space. This will include work on shared sequencing and execution
sharding, amongst other things.
