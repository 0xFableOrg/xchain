# Cross-Chain Interop Research

[Supported by Optimism Governance](https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-2498144202521042)

The goal of this effort is to conduct a thorough investigation of cross-chain — and in particular
cross-rollup — interoperability concerns.

Bluntly, one could equate interoperability with bridging: message-passing bridges, asset bridges,
and atomic cross-chain transaction bundles.

## Organization

This repository serves as a wiki for the research effort.

All pages are laid down flat in the [`pages`](./pages) directory so that they have a stable URL.
Structure can be superimposed via index pages if required.

Project management is done via GitHub issues for now.

Everyone is welcome to contribute via pull requests, though it is recommended to get in touch
(norswap [at] gmail) before investing signficant effort in any given direction.
